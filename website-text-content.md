#### The Daoist Sage AI Agent (2025)
- **Status Badge**: Case Study
- **Category**: AI Development & RAG Systems
- **Description**: A case study on grounding AI memory using a dedicated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to solve challenges of hallucination and unreliable memory in AI trading agents.
- **Details**: The core challenge emerged from developing an AI crypto trading agent where memory issues and hallucination severely limited reliability. AI hallucination causes confident generation of factually incorrect information, while fickle memory creates inability to recall crucial details from knowledge bases or maintain coherent context.
- **Solution**: The solution involved building a Daoist Sage Agent using RAG as its foundational memory and accuracy mechanism. As Product Manager and Lead Developer, I handled the full process from ideation to conceptual deployment.
- **Future Vision**: The future vision includes processing complex internal documentation and providing specialized, fact-checked assistance in regulated industries where precision and verifiability are crucial.

#### Eliza Trading Agent (2025)
- **Status Badge**: Pivoted  
- **Category**: AI-Powered Memecoin Trading
- **Description**: An attempt to develop an AI-powered memecoin trading bot to capitalize on Solana's volatility while managing risk.
- **Approach**: The approach involved training Mistral 7B on Pump.fun launch patterns combined with Twitter sentiment analysis. Integration with 3Commas API as a provider allowed testing of hybrid DEX/CEX strategy through paper trading on the 3Commas platform.
- **Outcome**: The outcome was clear: the system was inconsistent and kept hallucinating on the signals being fed to it. The project was pivoted due to inability to achieve reliable trading consistency.
- **Learning**: This failure led to valuable insights about AI reliability in financial applications and directly informed the development of the Daoist Sage Agent with its focus on grounded memory systems.
- **Documentation**: Project documentation available upon request

#### Kaiawhina Auckland (2023 – 2024)
- **Category**: Activism & Social Justice
- **Description**: In 2023, as global calls for a Free Palestine grew louder, I realized my skills and privilege needed redirecting. Joining Kaiawhina Auckland, I committed to honoring Māori sovereignty, supporting Palestinian freedom, and advancing climate justice.
- **Work Details**: The work involves weekly marshal duties for activations, disrupting "business as usual" at corporate complicity sites, and learning that actions matter more than hashtags. The experience taught crucial lessons: data is power (using Signal to track police or counter protestors movements at demonstrations), access is activism (always providing wheelchair routes and live captions), and joy is resistance (singing waiata at 5am blockades).
- **Impact**: This work reinforced that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum and provided hands-on experience in using tech skills for social justice organizing.
- **Link**: ▶ Learn About Kaiawhina

#### Drama School 202: The Illusion (2023)
- **Category**: Black Box Theatre Performance
- **Description**: A reimagining of Tony Kushner's baroque meta-theatrical fantasy as a contemporary meditation on love, artifice, and the transformative power of storytelling under director Leo Gene Peters.
- **Approach**: Our approach centered on staging the unreal by building a 1:1 cave to bring the audience into the world. We performed costume quick-changes in full view to highlight theatrical artifice and projected text fragments from Kushner's stage directions onto actors' bodies. The production challenged actors to master 17th-century verse while finding modern emotional truth.
- **Role**: As Theogenes - The Lover, I connected with the verbs that brought the character to life and genuinely fell in love on stage. I also taught yoga to the company every other day, helping connect with breath and body.
- **Archive**: Performance archived in personal collection

#### Vipassana Journey (2022 – Present)
- **Status Badge**: Ongoing
- **Category**: Personal Practice & Mindfulness
- **Background**: After burning out from building startups, I needed something no algorithm could provide. A way to sit with myself.
- **Practice**: The practice involves 10 day silent retreats completed at Dhamma Medini, NZ, with an intention of twice daily meditation sits. The approach eschews apps and hacks in favor of just the breath, the body, and whatever arises.
- **Insight**: The key insight: "It's not about achieving some perfect mental state, it's about seeing what's already there." This ongoing practice provides grounding and perspective that informs all other work.
- **Integration**: This foundation of mindfulness and presence has become integral to my approach to technology, bringing intention and awareness to how I build and interact with digital systems.

#### Talent Army (2022)
- **Status Badge**: Award Winner
- **Award**: Best UX Design, NZ Tech Innovation | Psychoactive
- **Description**: A reimagining of tech recruitment as a dynamic growth journey, replacing sterile job boards with living stories of career transformation.
- **Features**: The narrative-driven web experience featured claymation-style 3D animations, spontaneous "Easter egg" movements, and visual storytelling for both employers and candidates. The intelligent job board included custom API syncing between Webflow and JobAdder in real-time, JetBoost filtering that felt like Tinder for dream jobs, and Kiwi-tech coded icons replacing generic briefcase symbols.
- **Roles**: As Account Manager, I won the pitch against 4 agencies by demonstrating how storytelling reduces candidate drop-off. As Conductor, I managed 6 specialists across 3 timezones, and as Bridge Builder, I translated recruiter pain points into playful interactions.
- **Recognition**: The project was shortlisted for 2023 Webby Awards and became Talent Army's flagship client acquisition tool.

#### Blackbird VC (2022)
- **Location**: Australia | Psychoactive
- **Challenge**: Blackbird VC needed a digital presence as bold as their investments. One that would make founders feel seen, not just pitched to.
- **Solution**: We abandoned the tired "suits shaking hands" aesthetic and built an electric visual language featuring handmade documentary photography of real founders and bespoke animations mimicking startup momentum. The functional artistry organized content like a gallery with no buried decks, and interactive founder stories triggered by scroll velocity.
- **Role**: My role as Deal Maker involved working with the development team and Blackbird to envision a website that was both achievable and visually stunning, creating a rebellion against traditional VC digital clichés.

#### 121 Festival (2021)
- **Category**: Entertainment Technology | Psychoactive
- **Challenge**: Wellington's legendary Club 121 needed a website that could bottle their underground energy and pour it across screens nationwide. A digital mainstage for their debut festival.
- **Features**: The project featured psychedelic Kiwi immersion with native flora and fauna illustrations pulsing to ambient basslines, hover-triggered soundwave animations, and lineup reveals that felt like uncovering secret set times at the venue. The technical backbone included an Airtable/Zapier CMS allowing real-time vendor applications and volunteer coordination.
- **Roles**: As Project Manager, I pitched the "digital doof" concept after attending 3 club nights for research. As Systems Architect, I streamlined 14 stakeholder workflows into one unified backend while balancing festival chaos with UX clarity.
- **Status**: Festival concluded - site archived
